# Bank Management System (C++ Console Project)

This is a simple C++ project that simulates basic banking operations using structs, vectors, and functions.  
It is a menu-driven console application that allows users to:

- Create a new account
- Display all accounts
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Search for an account
- Delete an account

All operations are performed in memory (no file handling yet). The project is focused on implementing data structures and control flow logic in C++.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- C++ 
- Dev C++ / Code::Blocks (Tested)
- Structs, Vectors, Functions

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Add file handling to make data persistent
- Implement login system (admin/user roles)
- Convert to OOP using classes
- Add GUI using C++ Qt or migrate to web stack

## üîΩ How to Run

1. Copy the code from `bank_management.cpp`
2. Compile and run using any modern C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Dev C++, OnlineGDB)
3. Follow the on-screen menu prompts
